# Object Detection with ResNet-50 and Custom Detection Head 
### Comparison with Pre-Trained YOLOv5 Variants

In this project, we developed a custom object detection model using a **ResNet-50 backbone** and compared its performance against pre-trained YOLOv5 variants: **YOLOv5n (nano)**, **YOLOv5s (small)**, **YOLOv5m (medium)**, and **YOLOv5l (large)**. 

The evaluation was conducted on the **COCO dataset** using key performance metrics:
- **Recall**
- **Precision**
- **Intersection over Union (IoU)**

These metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of the models' accuracy, detection capabilities, and bounding box quality. The comparison highlights the trade-offs between the custom model and YOLOv5 variants in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, offering insights into their suitability for real-world applications.

## Custom Model Architecture

The custom object detection model uses a **ResNet-50 backbone** to extract robust image features. It is tailored for object detection tasks on the COCO dataset and is designed to predict:
- **Fixed number of bounding boxes per image**
- **Class probabilities** for objects
- **Bounding box coordinates**

This model leverages:
- **CrossEntropy Loss** for classification
- **Smooth L1 Loss** for bounding box regression

While not as optimized as YOLO models, this modular design serves as an effective baseline for understanding the fundamentals of object detection.

### 1. Backbone: ResNet-50
- **Purpose:** 
  - Extracts high-level spatial features from input images.
- **Implementation:**
  - Pre-trained **ResNet-50** from `torchvision`, with fully connected layers removed:
    ```python
    self.backbone = torchvision.models.resnet50(weights="DEFAULT")
    self.backbone = nn.Sequential(*list(self.backbone.children())[:-2])
    ```
  - Outputs feature maps of size `[batch_size, 2048, H/32, W/32]`.
- **Key Properties:** 
  - Uses ImageNet-pretrained weights for robust feature extraction.

---

### 2. Classification Head
- **Purpose:** Predicts class probabilities for each bounding box.
- **Structure:**
  - Input: Flattened feature maps of size `[batch_size, 2048 * 7 * 7]`.
  - Layers:
    - Fully connected layer to reduce dimensionality.
    - **ReLU** for non-linearity and **Dropout** for regularization.
    - Final fully connected layer outputs logits shaped as `[batch_size, num_boxes_per_image, num_classes]`.
  - **Loss Function:** 
    - **CrossEntropy Loss** compares predicted class probabilities with ground truth labels.

---

### 3. Bounding Box Regression Head
- **Purpose:** Predicts bounding box coordinates for each detected object.
- **Structure:**
  - Input: Flattened feature maps of size `[batch_size, 2048 * 7 * 7]`.
  - Layers:
    - Fully connected layer to reduce dimensionality.
    - **ReLU** for non-linearity and **Dropout** for regularization.
    - Final fully connected layer outputs 4 values (`[x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max]`) for each bounding box.
  - **Loss Function:** 
    - **Smooth L1 Loss** measures the difference between predicted and ground truth coordinates.

---

### Loss Functions

In this model, two loss functions are combined to optimize predictions during training:
1. **Classification Loss:** Ensures correct class predictions for each bounding box.
2. **Regression Loss:** Ensures accurate bounding box predictions.

The total loss is computed as:

$$
\text{Total Loss} = \text{Classification Loss}+\text{Regression Loss}
$$

## Metrics

### Intersection over Union (IoU)
- **Definition:**
  - IoU quantifies the overlap between the predicted and ground truth bounding boxes.

$$
\text{IoU} = \frac{\text{Area of Overlap}}{\text{Area of Union}}
$$

- **Purpose:**
  - Evaluates the quality of predicted bounding boxes.
  - Higher IoU indicates better alignment with ground truth.

### Precision and Recall

| **Metric**   | **Focus**                   | **High Value Indicates**             |
|--------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Precision** | Quality of predictions      | Most predictions are correct         |
| **Recall**    | Completeness of detections  | Most ground truth objects are detected |

#### **Precision**
Precision measures the proportion of correct predictions (True Positives) among all predictions made by the model:

$$
\text{Precision} = \frac{\text{True Positives (TP)}}{\text{True Positives (TP)} + \text{False Positives (FP)}}
$$

#### **Recall**
Recall measures the proportion of actual objects (ground truth) that the model correctly detected:

$$
\text{Recall} = \frac{\text{True Positives (TP)}}{\text{True Positives (TP)} + \text{False Negatives (FN)}}
$$

## YOLO Model

**YOLO (You Only Look Once)** is a state-of-the-art object detection model that predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities in a single forward pass, making it highly efficient for real-time applications.

### Features:
- **Single-stage detector**: Combines detection and classification in one pass.
- **Grid-based detection**: Divides the image into a grid and assigns each cell responsibility for detecting objects.
- **Pretrained Weights**: YOLO models are pretrained on the **COCO dataset**, offering out-of-the-box detection for 80 object classes.

### YOLOv5 Pretrained Models

YOLOv5 offers multiple pretrained models optimized for various use cases:

| **Model Variant** | **Description**                                    | **Performance**                   |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **YOLOv5n**        | Nano version, optimized for low-resource devices. | Smallest and fastest.             |
| **YOLOv5s**        | Small version, balances speed and accuracy.       | Ideal for lightweight tasks.      |
| **YOLOv5m**        | Medium version, more accurate but slower.         | Suitable for balanced use cases.  |
| **YOLOv5l**        | Large version, high accuracy but resource-intensive. | For high-performance applications. |
